# JamesConvoyDefense

The objective of the game is to defend the convoy from incoming planes.

The player controls a tank and the tank's turret rotates and faces the position of the mouse.
The turret can fire and shoot planes. If a plane is hit, it takes damage or is destroyed.

If a plane hits a truck in the convoy, the truck is destroyed. If all three trucks in the convoy are destroyed, the game is over and lost.
If time runs out and there is at least one truck remaining in the convoy, the game is won.

Left-click the mouse to fire.
To exit the game, click the window exit button at any time.
